Simple program to make pixel art. It has 1:1 preview and a 16 colour pallete. Pressing [S] will save file "art.bmp" (by ovewriting last one!).

### GAME ENGINE - SPACE SHOOTER
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/L9uO1tP.jpg)

My experiment to make a pseudo 3D game engine. To do this I need a real game to work on. That's how this unnamed space shooter has born.
Features:
- infinite terrain scrolling
- smooth ship movement and vector animation
- fixed 16fps (best for my display)
